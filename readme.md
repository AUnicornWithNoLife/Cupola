# Cupola

Generate long exposure images (or video) from a video

unfortunatly this only runs on windows, since computesharp utilizes the DirectX api (in theory you can run this under linux using wine + dxvk (i would recommend if you want to use this, launch it from steam with proton)) (also, if you want to run this under macOS, you will have to use the game porting toolkit, as it uses directX 12)

Cupola - API

Tranquility - WPF app to use Cupola with a nice GUI (tranquility is probably gonna be moved into a seperate repo at some point)
